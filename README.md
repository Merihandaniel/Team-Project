##World Happiness Report: Exploring the Impact of COVID-19 on Happiness

Welcome to our project exploring the world of happiness and its potential connection to the COVID-19 pandemic. In this analysis, we delve into the World Happiness Report dataset to investigate whether the global health crisis has had an impact on people's well-being.

Our primary data source for this project is the World Happiness Report dataset, which we obtained from Kaggle, a platform for data science enthusiasts and professionals. The dataset provides valuable insights into happiness scores and various factors contributing to happiness across different countries and years.

The World Happiness Report is an annual publication produced by an agency dedicated to studying and measuring happiness around the world. The report aims to shed light on the factors that influence happiness levels in societies and guide policymakers in their efforts to promote well-being.

To conduct our analysis, we utilize the dataset compiled from the World Happiness Report website. This official website serves as a reliable source for the annual reports and is maintained by the agency responsible for generating them.

With the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, the world witnessed unprecedented challenges, affecting numerous aspects of people's lives. By examining the happiness data in light of this global crisis, we aim to gain insights into any potential impact on overall happiness levels and explore the factors contributing to this relationship.

Through our exploration, we hope to uncover meaningful patterns, trends, and potential correlations between COVID-19 and happiness. The findings from this analysis may provide valuable insights for researchers, policymakers, and individuals interested in understanding the effects of the pandemic on well-being.

We invite you to join us on this journey as we delve into the world happiness data, leveraging statistical analysis and data visualization techniques to gain a deeper understanding of the potential impact of COVID-19 on happiness levels across countries and time.

Let's dive in and explore the fascinating world of happiness together!
